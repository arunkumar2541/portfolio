## MSc Project – Viral Dynamics Simulation (Aston University)

**Problem:**  
Large-scale molecular simulation data required automated analysis to assess system stability and interaction behaviour.

**What I did:**
- Processed and analysed 50GB+ of molecular simulation output data using Python
- Built automated pipelines for RMSD-based stability analysis
- Applied statistical validation and visual diagnostics to interpret results
- Structured and analysed data generated from high-performance computing runs

## BSc Project – Community Complaint Analytics System

**Problem:**  
Manual, paper-based complaint handling caused delays and lack of visibility for community issues.

**What I did:**
- Designed a relational SQL database to store and track complaints
- Built a web-based system to capture, manage, and acknowledge reports
- Implemented role-based workflows for users and administrators
- Structured data for reporting and operational tracking

**Outcome:**  
Created a centralised system that improved traceability and response handling compared to manual processes.
