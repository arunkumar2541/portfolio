## MSc Project – Viral Dynamics Simulation (Aston University)

**Problem:**  
Large-scale molecular simulation data required automated analysis to assess stability and interaction behaviour in a viral system.

**What I did:**
- Processed and analysed 50GB+ of simulation output data using Python
- Built automated pipelines for RMSD, RMSF, and stability analysis
- Validated results using statistical measures and visual diagnostics
- Worked with high-performance computing outputs and structured large datasets for analysis

**Outcome:**  
Improved reliability and repeatability of simulation analysis, enabling faster interpretation of complex molecular dynamics data.

**Evidence:**  
- [Final Dissertation (PDF)](assets/Dissertation.pdf)

**Tech:** Python, data pipelines, statistical analysis, automation

## BSc Project – Community Complaint Analytics System

**Problem:**  
Manual, paper-based complaint handling caused delays and lack of visibility for community issues.

**What I did:**
- Designed a relational SQL database to store and track complaints
- Built a web-based system to capture, manage, and acknowledge reports
- Implemented role-based workflows for users and administrators
- Structured data for reporting and operational tracking

**Outcome:**  
Created a centralised system that improved traceability and response handling compared to manual processes.

**Evidence:**  
- [Final Project Report (PDF)](assets/BSc-Project-Report.pdf)

**Tech:** SQL, ASP.NET, database design
